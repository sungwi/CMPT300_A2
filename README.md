- I did alone; do not belong to any group. 
- Everything works specified by the documentation.
- (eg)Running Command is

        ./s-talk 1218 [host name] 1219

        ./s-talk 1219 [host name] 1218

- Program ends with "!" commands
 : You are supposed to get "Ternimation Command ["!"] Implemented. Session Ends."
   Or
   "Ternimation Command ["!"] Implemented by other client. Session Ends." 
                                                            if other client terminates.
